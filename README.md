# Indian_Monsoons
This is the work I did during my second year Internship at ICTS-TIFR, Bengaluru under **Prof. Amit Apte** in the summer of 2017. 

The main aim of the project was to develop a method for predicting rainfall in India using the previous data for the same. For this, I tried to apply the ARIMA model on the rainfall data on different spatial and time scales in India.
